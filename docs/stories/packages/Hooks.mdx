# ODE React UI: Hooks

![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@ode-react-ui/hooks?style=flat-square)

## Getting Started

All shared Hooks between packages and React Apps.

### Build

```bash
pnpm run build
```

### Lint

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

Use Eslint configuration file from `config` workspace to check all files inside `src` folder.

```bash
pnpm run fix
```

If `pnpm run lint` shows issues, run this command to fix them.

### Prettier

```bash
pnpm run format
```

This command starts `format:check` + `format:write` using Prettier configuration file from `config` workspace.

## Dev

Every hook should have:

- its own folder (e.g: `useImage`)
- its own file (e.g: `useImage.ts`)
- an `index.ts` file
- `docs` and `stories` (e.g: `useImage.docs.mdx` / `useImage.stories.mdx`)
